This is typically a short description or title for the property and is a string type variable.\n","\n","3. **host_id**: A unique identifier assigned to each host. It is a numerical value that helps in distinguishing one host from another, even if they have multiple listings.\n","\n","4. **host_name**: The name of the host. This can be the personal name or alias of the individual or organization managing the listing. It’s a string variable.\n","\n","5. **neighbourhood_group**: The broader geographical area in which the listing is located. In the context of New York City, this might refer to boroughs like Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, etc. It is a categorical variable.\n","\n","6. **neighbourhood**: The specific neighborhood within the borough where the listing is located. For example, it could be neighborhoods like Williamsburg or SoHo. This is a categorical variable and provides more precise location data.\n","\n","7. **latitude**: The geographic latitude of the Airbnb listing, representing the North-South position on the Earth's surface.

This is a numerical variable and provides insight into the booking policy of the listing.\n","\n","12. **number_of_reviews**: The total number of reviews the listing has received. This is a numeric variable that gives an idea of how popular or frequently reviewed the listing is.\n","\n","13. **last_review**: The date of the most recent review left by a guest. It is stored as a string, but ideally, it would be a datetime type variable. This field helps in determining the freshness of the reviews.\n","\n","14. **reviews_per_month**: The average number of reviews the listing receives per month.

The primary manipulations I undertook are as follows:\n","\n","1. **Handling Missing Values**:\n","   - **Latitude and Longitude**: These values were rounded to two decimal places to ensure uniform precision and improve consistency. Rounding geographic coordinates is a common practice to reduce unnecessary precision that may not be useful for analysis at the city level.\n","   - **Last Review**: Missing values in the `last_review` column were filled with the placeholder `\"No Reviews\"`, as many listings may not have received reviews. This allows the dataset to reflect the absence of reviews without losing information.\n","   - **Reviews per Month**: Missing values for `reviews_per_month` were set to `0`. This was done under the assumption that if a listing does not have reviews, it would logically have 0 reviews per month. This prevents the column from introducing bias due to null values.\n","   - **Numerical Columns**: For columns with numeric data types (such as `price`, `minimum_nights`, `number_of_reviews`), missing values were filled using the mean of the respective column. The mean was selected due to its common usage for imputation in numerical data, providing a reasonable estimate for missing values without significantly affecting the distribution.\n","   - **Categorical Columns**: Missing values in categorical columns, such as `name`, `host_name`, and `room_type`, were filled using the mode (the most frequent value). This ensures that the missing data is replaced with the most common category, maintaining consistency in the dataset.\n","\n","2. **Insights Found**:\n","   - **Geographic Consistency**: The rounding of `latitude` and `longitude` data to two decimal places helped ensure that the geographic data is accurate enough for analysis without being excessively precise, improving performance in spatial analysis.\n","   - **Missing Reviews**: The handling of missing `last_review` and `reviews_per_month` provided a clear insight that many listings in the dataset either haven't been reviewed yet or haven't received frequent reviews, which is important for understanding user engagement with listings.\n","   - **Data Imputation**: By filling missing values in numerical columns with the mean, and in categorical columns with the mode, the dataset was made more complete without introducing significant bias. However, filling missing `reviews_per_month` with 0 could introduce assumptions about the listings with no reviews, which should be considered in later analyses.\n","   \n","In summary, these manipulations ensure the dataset is clean and prepared for analysis, allowing for reliable insights to be drawn from the data, such as patterns in reviews, pricing, or room types. This data wrangling process helped in reducing the noise from missing values and improved the overall quality of the dataset."],"metadata":{"id":"LbyXE7I1olp8"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## ***4.
